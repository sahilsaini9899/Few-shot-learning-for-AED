# Few-shot-learning-for-AED
In our baseline model, we have trained our model model using traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) by a sample of size 1600 (1500 for training and 100 for testing) from total 8732 observations of
UrbanSound8K dataset. We are achieving training and testing accuracy of around 52% and 57%, both are
not so good. Our main project aims at training a model with few shot learning which consists of k samples
per class where k = 1(1)5. We use Siamese Network approach of few shot learning. Finally we get 91% as
training accuracy and 75% as testing accuracy.
